/**
 * Controls communication between objects so neither object
 * has to be coupled to the others.
 * 
 * 1. allows for loosely coupled system;
 * 2. one object manages all communication;
 * 3. many to many relationship.
 * 4. the mediator can manage the communication and
 * make decisions based upon information that is coming in.
 * 
 * 
 * Example: scenario of Observer pattern but, in this case,
 * Task will call the Mediator instead of each Observer
